# üêç Jaclang Assignment: AI-Powered Applications

This repository contains the solution for a two-part Jaclang assignment focused on demonstrating **Scale-Agnostic Programming** (Cloud-Readiness) and **AI Integration** using the `byLLM` plugin.

The project is structured into two applications:
1.  **AI-Enhanced Guessing Game:** The completed tutorial example utilizing Jac's core features.
2.  **AI-Powered To-Do List:** A custom application that uses an LLM to automatically suggest task priorities.
